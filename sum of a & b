To print sum of two numbers, here we are considering variables a & b.

consider,

int a = 10;

int b = 05;

form above a, b are variables and they are of type integer.

Next in order to store the sum value we will create a 'sum' variable.

int sum = a + b;

Note: I have taken sum as a variable you can take any thing which should be suitable for your problem statement. By looking at that variable, we should understand  what it performs in the program.

the sum variable will calculate the sum of two numbers. i.e a, b
